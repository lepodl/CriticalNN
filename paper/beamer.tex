% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Motivation}

\subsection{The Basic Problem That We Studied}

\begin{frame}{Network Dynamics}  % {Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Network response correspond to specific neuronal parameter, including fire rate, degree of irregularity, spatiotemporal patterns in neuronal spike trains and neuronal critical dynamics.
  \item
	Explor the influence of simulation size of neuronal network as well as the community stuctural network. 2000, 5000, 10000, ..., 100 million. 
  \item 
  Synapase density and input heterogeneity.(to be confirmed)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Theoretical explanation}

  Mainly three aspects\ldots
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Explain the mechanism underly the trainsition dynamics.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 
    input current variablity analysis.
    \item
      Mean-filed equation and hopf bifuraction
    \item    
      The real part of fixed point is decreasing.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
   fit the network response with a simple f unction.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
